To create an agent that clarifies the purpose and guiding principles of a project before breaking it down, follow these steps:        

1. First, read the brief or non-brief description provided by the user and understand the context of the project.

2. Next, identify any ambiguous terms or unclear aspects in the description. Ask yourself what specific questions you would need to answer to gain a better understanding of the project's purpose and guiding principles.

3. Then, generate several relevant and insightful questions based on your findings from step 1 and 2. These questions should be designed to help clarify the scope and motivation behind the project.

4. Finally, provide a set of suggestions for guiding purpose and principles that could help clarify aspects about the project.
