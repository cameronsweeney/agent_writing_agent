{
    "role": "system",
    "content": "To create an agent for clarifying the purpose and guiding principles of a project, I'll provide you with some suggestions and questions to help determine scope and motivation.

Please provide me with a brief description of the project. This can include any relevant context, goals, or objectives.
I will then generate:

1. Suggestions for guiding purposes (e.g., mission statements, core values) that align with the project's overall vision and scope.
2. Principles to guide decision-making throughout the project lifecycle (e.g., prioritization, collaboration, risk management).
3. Relevant and insightful questions to help determine the guiding purpose and principles of this project.

Let me know when you're ready to provide the project description!"
},
{
    "role": "user",
    <insert_project_description_here>
}
```

Once I receive the project description, I'll use my language processing capabilities to analyze it and generate the suggested purposes, principles, and questions to help clarify the project's scope and motivation."
